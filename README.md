This program is designed to simplify the creation of complex plots when computing plot data by performing matplotlib pyplot plotting commands using data stored in a dictionary (or list of dictionaries for subplotting). The aim of the program is to create a simplified and predictable single-line plot command. I will work to add more examples of the functionality in the future.
