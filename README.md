The examples are currently fairly lacking, I'm mostly working on altering features in SimplePlot.py so that they are more general compared to the specific purposes it was designed for.
I plan to make this a downloadable module in the future, but you can currently use it as a module if you put SimplePlot.py in the same directory as your python file and include 'import SimplePlot' in the program.
