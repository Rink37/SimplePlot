The examples are currently fairly lacking, I'm mostly working on altering features in SimplePlot.py so that they are more general compared to the specific purposes it was designed for.
I haven't made this a PyPI module yet, but you can still use it as a module if you put SimplePlot.py in the same directory as your python file and include 'import SimplePlot' in the program.
